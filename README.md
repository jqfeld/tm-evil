# Vim-like text editing in TeXmacs

This is my attempt to add vim keybindings to TeXmacs. Everything here is very 
much WIP.

## Install
Install via
```bash
cd ~/.TeXmacs/plugins && git clone https://github.com/jqfeld/tm-vim.git 
```
Vim keybindings are activated automatically. They can be deactivated with the 
menu entry "Vim mode" in the "Insert" menu.
